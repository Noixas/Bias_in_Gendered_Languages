# Examining Gender Bias in Languages with Grammatical Gender
This repo contains the code and data used for our EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 Paper: [Examining Gender Bias in Languages with Grammatical Gender](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02224)

All the code used in this paper is contained in the jupyter notebook, and the seed words used are contained in the other text files. 
Note that we do not put embeddings used here: for original embeddings, please check [MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE); for our mitigated embeddings, they can be produced following the sections in our notebook.
